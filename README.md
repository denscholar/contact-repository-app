# Contact Directory with Create React App
This is a simple contact directory built in React that enable user store/save their contact and refer to it whenever, they need it. They can also delete it when they no longer need it again. This is a practice react project that has the functionality of CREATE, READ and DELETE; using local storage to preserve and persite data. More functionality will be added to it as time goes on such as routing, using API in place of local storage etc
